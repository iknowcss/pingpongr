pingpongr
=========

An interactive scoreboard to track ping pong games written. **pingpongr** is 
powered by [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [express](http://expressjs.com/), and 
[Socket.IO](http://socket.io/).

What does it do?
----------------
**pingpongr** allows a single **score keeper** to keep track of the score of a 
game of ping pong. The score may be displayed on one or more **score boards**. 
The **score keeper** may award points to a player by tapping or clicking a 
button on a very simple interface. The score on all **score boards** is updated 
in real time.
